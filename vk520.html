                   <h6>Benefits of Fruits</h6>
Fruits have many health benefits that help prevent complications like heat stroke, high blood pressure, cancer, heart disorders, and diabetes. They effectively fight skin disorders and promote healthy hair growth. It is always suggested to eat fresh and ripe fruits to get the maximum benefits from them.

What are Fruits?
Fruits are the edible fleshy part of a tree or a plant that contains seeds. Fruits come in a variety of flavors, including sweet, sour, bittersweet, and many more. They are great sources of many nutrients required by our body.

Types of Fruits
There are 8 main types of fruits. They are:

Simple Fruit

These fruits develop from the ripening of a single ovary of a flower. Simple fruits are of two types, dry and fleshy. Dry simple fruits can be dehiscent or indehiscent. Brazil nuts, strawberries, coconut, walnuts, hazelnuts, etc., are some dry simple fruits. Fleshy simple fruits are those that have a partial or full fleshy pericarp (fruit wall) on maturity. Some examples include cherry, tomato, olives, peach, plums, and cranberry.

Aggregate Fruit

These fruits develop from multiple ovaries of a single flower. There are four main types of aggregate fruits, including follicles, achenes, drupelets, and berries. Raspberry, blackberry, and custard apple are some examples.

Multiple Fruit

                </div>
Multiple fruits originate from an inflorescence, which means a cluster of flowers. Each of these flowers individually produces a fruit and the fruits, on maturity, come in the form of a single mass. Pineapple, figs, mulberry, etc., are some multiple fruits.

Berries

Berry is a type of simple fruit as it develops from a single ovary of a single flower. Cranberry and blueberry are the two most common examples of berries.

Accessory Fruit

Any fruit whose edible part comes from the ovary, as well as other parts of the flower, is an accessory fruit. It can be simple, multiple, or an aggregate fruit. Most common examples include pineapple, apple, stone fruit, and strawberry.

Seedless Fruit

Seedless fruits mature in two ways. The first is where the fruit develops without parthenocarpy, whereas the second is where pollination stimulates fruit development. These are the most valuable fruits as they are consumed by a majority of people.
