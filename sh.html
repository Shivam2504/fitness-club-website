                   <h5>Health and Fitness parameters</h5>
                   Health can generally be measured by three main parameters: physical, psychological and nutritional. Physical health means the physical image of a person; Nutritional health means the presence of essential nutrients in the body to fight diseases with immunity. Mental health means the ability of a person to maintain patience, composure and composure in all circumstances of life.
Healthy and nutritious eating, exercising, getting enough sleep, avoiding the intake of harmful substances are just a few simple ways to stay healthy and fit. These facts and figures are directly related to our mental, physical and emotional health.
 The main reasons leading to deterioration of health are the following:

Daily Stress â€“ Students often feel stressed about schoolwork and exams. Professionals are also prone to stress related to their lives and work. Such conditions lead to unbalanced mental health.
Depression - Prolonged stress about something leads to depression and becomes a health problem.
Intake of harmful substances such as alcohol, preserved food, etc. has a negative impact on physical and mental health and fitness.
Lack of sleep - People tend to work late at night, constantly use their phones, etc. and forego their predetermined sleep cycle. As suggested by medical experts, a certain sleep time is mandatory for every individual. Lack of sleep results in an unhealthy lifestyle.
Junk Food - Junk food intake has replaced the proper diet that one should be consuming. Unhealthy dietary habits directly create unhealthy well-being.
