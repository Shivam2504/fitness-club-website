                   <h6>Exercises for hearthealth</h6>Exercise and your heart
Regular exercise is important for all adults to keep their muscles strong and flexible, and is essential for a healthy heart. Physical activity and exercise not only help prevent your risk of heart attack and heart disease, but it can also help you improve and manage heart disease that has already developed.

This article discusses the best type of exercise for optimal heart health.Exercise and regular exercise have several benefits for heart health, including: 1


Increases the strength of the heart muscle
Improves lung function
Lowers blood pressure
Lowers high cholesterol
Lowers high blood sugar
Lowers high triglycerides
Lowers levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory protein that is elevated in chronic conditions
Reduces the risk of heart attack and heart disease
Types of exercises
To improve your heart health and reduce your risk of heart disease, it's important to include aerobics, strength training, and stretching in your exercise routine.
Aerobic exercise
Aerobic exercise is any activity that makes your heart beat faster and your breathing rate faster than at rest, pumping oxygen-rich blood to your working muscles. Over time, regular aerobics strengthens your heart and lungs, making them work more efficiently. Aerobic exercise includes:

To walk
Run
Hiking
Swimming
Jumping rope
To dance
Bicycles
Jumping jacks
Walking stairs
To play sports
Weight training
Strength training is an exercise designed to specifically increase muscle strength through resistance training. Resistance can be in the form of weights, resistance bands, or using your own body weight with moves such as:

Imprints
Pull up
dips
Squat
lunges
Stepping stones
Stretch
Stretching is a form of exercise that increases the flexibility of your muscles and the ability to move your joints through their full range of motion with movement. Good muscle flexibility and joint mobility is necessary to reduce the risk of injury from physical activity and exercise.

How long should you train and how often?
According to 2019 guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, adults should participate in one of the following periods of physical activity weekly to promote optimal heart health and reduce the risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD):2

150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity
75 minutes of intense physical activity
An equal combination of moderate and vigorous physical activity
The exercise intensity is grouped into the following categories:3

<img src="download (2).jpg" alt="">
Light intensity: walking slowly, cooking, light housework
Moderate intensity: brisk walking (2.4-4.0 miles per hour), biking (5-9 miles per hour), dancing, active yoga, recreational swimming, gardening, vacuuming, raking leaves
Vigorous intensity: jogging, running, walking, cycling (â‰¥10 miles per hour), lap swimming, jumping rope, aerobics, lifting weights, climbing stairs, shoveling snow
These guidelines suggest that a shorter duration of physical activity of 10 minutes or less may be just as beneficial as a longer duration of more than 10 minutes. Therefore, the total duration of weekly physical activity should be emphasized more than the duration of each individual activity or training session.

To make it easier to reach your training goals, the duration of physical activity can be divided into 10-minute sessions: fifteen 10-minute training sessions spread over the week can have similar benefits to five 30-minute sessions.

Additional exercise beyond the minimum recommendations further promotes better heart health and lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease. Improved positive outcomes have been associated with the following duration of physical activity per week:

300 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity
150 minutes or more of vigorous physical activity
However, very high levels of exercise well beyond these amounts have no significant additional benefits.

For adults who are unable to meet minimum exercise recommendations, participation in some form of exercise is still beneficial for good heart health. Unless your healthcare provider advises you to avoid physical activity for medical reasons, some exercise, when done safely and properly, is better than none.

Exercise Precautions
Sedentary individuals should always start slowly and gradually increase exercise intensity, duration and frequency over time. If you become easily short of breath, have heart disease, or have high blood pressure, your health care provider can give you specific safety guidelines to follow.

For most adults without significant heart, lung, blood vessel, muscle or joint problems, walking at an average pace of 3 miles per hour is generally a safe and effective way to add moderate-intensity physical activity to your day.

Always be sure to check with your health care provider before beginning or increasing any exercise program to make sure your heart, lungs, and blood vessels are healthy enough to function properly.

Being active if you have heart disease
If you have heart disease, your heart doesn't work as efficiently as it should, and it will have to work harder to pump blood around your body during exercise. Therefore, you should start with a lower intensity and shorter duration of physical activity to give your heart time to get stronger and build the capacity to support the cardiovascular demands of exercise.

Your healthcare provider may also recommend keeping your heart rate within a target range and stopping exercise if your heart rate exceeds a certain limit to protect your heart and prevent damage from cardiac overload. These values â€‹â€‹are personalized for you depending on your average resting heart rate.

Overview
Exercise is a specific form of physical activity that is structured and planned and includes aerobic exercise, strength training, and stretching. At least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week is recommended to maintain good heart health and lower the risk of heart disease. Always be sure to talk to your healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program to make sure it's right for you.

A word from very good
Movement is an important part of that
