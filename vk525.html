                   <h6>Cardiac problems</h6>
Moderate exercise a few days a week is good for your health, but new research shows that more is not always better.

At the risk of encouraging you to binge-watch on the couch a little longer, too much exercise may be bad for your heart, say researchers in a new study.

But before you get too comfortable, keep in mind that an inactive lifestyle increases your risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and a host of other chronic diseases.

We know this because scientists have been studying the lower limits of exercise for many years.

All to answer the question: What is the minimum amount of physical activity you need each week to live longer and healthier?

More studies have recently begun to look at the other end of the exercise spectrum to see if more is always better.

Extreme exercise can carry risks
One of these studies was published Oct. 16 in Mayo Clinic Proceedings.

Researchers found that people who exercised well above national physical activity guidelines for years were more likely to develop coronary artery calcification (CAC) in middle age.

CAC, which is measured using CT scans, indicates that calcium-containing plaques are present in the arteries of the heart - a predictor of heart disease.

The study included nearly 3,200 people. Researchers followed them for 25 years, starting when they were young adults.

At the start of the study and during three to eight follow-up visits, participants reported how often and what types of physical activities they engaged in.

Researchers used this information to divide the participants into three groups: those who met the exercise guidelines, those who fell below them, and those who exceeded them at least three times.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' "2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans" recommend that adults engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous, aerobic activity.

High-intensity activities include running, cycling, swimming, fitness or dance classes, and strenuous sports.

Moderate-intensity activities include walking, hiking, golf, home exercise, and gardening.

People who exercised three times the recommended amount -- or the equivalent of 450 minutes a week of moderate activity -- had a 27 percent higher risk of developing CAC during the study period, compared to those who exercised the least.

The effects of extreme exercise were even greater for white participants.

This group had an 80 percent higher risk of developing CAC. The risk was slightly higher for white men than for white women.

Statistically, however, the results based on race and sex were only significant for white men. This is probably because the other groups had too few participants.

The study also highlighted the benefits of regularly meeting exercise guidelines.

People who exercised less than recommended amounts were more likely to develop high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes in middle age.

Exercise and heart health
Does this mean that the presence of CAC in people who exercise at least 7.5 hours a week is later a sign of heart disease?

The answer isâ€¦ possible.

"High levels of exercise over time can put stress on the arteries, leading to higher CAC," said Dr. Jamal Rana, a study author, in a press release. "However, this plaque buildup may be of the more stable kind, and thus less likely to rupture and cause heart attack, which was not evaluated in this study."

Rana said they plan to continue to monitor the participants to see how many have heart attacks, other health problems or die early.

Other studies have found similar harms from high doses of physical activity.

In the Copenhagen City Heart Study, moderate joggers had a 3-fold increased risk of premature death, compared to light joggers. For strenuous joggers, the risk was nine times higher.

The Million Women Study found that women who performed strenuous activities on a daily basis had a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, or a blood clot that broke loose in the blood, compared to moderate exercisers.

However, not all studies indicate that extreme exercise is bad for your health.

In a Swedish study of nearly 74,000 non-elite long-distance cross-country skiers, those who finished more races had a lower risk of dying early.

Other studies have shown that the arteries of male ultra-distance runners have larger diameters and can dilate more than those of physically inactive men.

The authors of the current study wrote that while extreme athletes may have higher amounts of CAC, wider arteries mean it "does not necessarily lead to adverse clinical outcomes."

Of course, none of this is a reason to stop being active. In fact, many Americans could probably use a little more physical activity in their lives.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), just over half of American adults met aerobic activity guidelines. And only one-fifth met guidelines for both aerobic and strengthening activities.

The current study, like other research, suggests that there may be an upper limit to the benefits of exercise. After that, the added stress can take a toll on your body, especially the heart.

For those dedicated athletes who like to push their limits, this research is even more reason to make an extra effort to take care of your heart.

This includes eating a healthy diet, quitting smoking, and learning how to manage your stress with practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness training.
