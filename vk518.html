                   <h6>Exercises for good digestion</h6>
Many people struggle with digestive problems and often receive conflicting advice on the best way to solve them.

In this article, we look at some of the most common problems and consider exercise as a possible solution.

Specifically, we treat:


Common digestive problems
Exercises to aid digestion
How it fits in with a healthy diet
It's frustrating when your body can't tolerate healthy foods like veggies, beans, nuts, and seeds, but don't give up on healthy eating!

There are some methods, supplements and exercises that can help you digest your food and I explain them all in this video.

The digestive system and common complaints
The digestive system is a complex set of interconnected organs that work together to process the food we consume, breaking it down into nutrients that are then absorbed by our body and transported to our cells to use for energy, growth and repair.

Exercises to aid digestion
Digestion begins as soon as you put food in your mouth, pass through the gastrointestinal tract and then mix with digestive juices that break down the food into molecules. The food that is not absorbed by the body passes through our body and leaves it as waste products.

But for many people it is not that simple.

According to the American Nutrition Association, 70,000,000 people experience digestive problems such as heartburn, IBS, constipation, abdominal pain and diarrhea every day.

There are several reasons why people suffer from digestive problems, namely the typical Western diet of cooked and processed foods that are full of depleted enzymes, which compete with the already limited supply of enzymes our bodies produce.

Many people turn to medications for digestive help, but is there a more natural way to combat these issues?

Could exercise be part of the solution?
It's common knowledge that exercise in general is good for you; whether you are interested in weight loss, stronger muscles or overall fitness.

Exercises to aid digestion
But its benefits extend far beyond these and can help create a healthier digestive system, among other things.

Different types of exercise have different effects on the digestive system:

Exercises such as cycling can help with heartburn, reducing its symptoms and effects on the body
Lighter exercises, such as breathing exercises, may be beneficial for people with bowel problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, and IBS
Exercise doesn't have to be intense to have an effect; just 15 minutes of exercise a day can do wonders for your digestive system.

Exercises to aid digestion
Exercises that target the abs are considered beneficial, but there are a range of exercises you can do that don't fall into the intense aerobic or cardio categories that can benefit your overall health and digestive health as a whole:

Exercises to aid digestion - Walking
Walk – After eating, it is common not to want to exercise or to go too far from the couch. However, a short 15 minute walk can do wonders for your digestive system. Walking speeds up the rate at which food moves through the stomach and stimulates your abdomen, giving your body that extra boost it needs while digesting food faster.
Yoga – Yoga is a brilliant form of exercise and can be as intense as you want it to be. Even if you are new to yoga, you can still reap the benefits and use simple techniques, such as a yoga block, to relax yourself into the exercises. Yoga begins with deep breathing to relax the body and mind. Certain yoga sequences can be followed to stimulate your abdominal organs while also massaging and strengthening them.
Bodyweight Exercise – Any form of exercise is good for your digestive system as long as it is light weight and not too intense. Regularly performing bodyweight exercises (such as planks, sit-ups) can not only help strengthen your core muscles, but also work in a similar way to yoga, toning and massaging your abs through low intensity.
Qigong Breathing - Tai Chi and Qigong Breathing are combined methods of Qi exercise that are known to gently massage the internal organs and promote the stimulation of blood circulation and healthy digestion. The exercises relax the body, which in turn improves microcirculation, allowing the body to absorb nutrients through the digestive system in a more effective manner.
Don't mind your diet
While exercise can certainly help your digestive system, it won't overcome a really bad diet.

Aiming for a balanced diet is key when it comes to digestive health; avoid unhealthy fats and fried foods, spicy foods, and dairy products, all of which are common factors in digestive problems.

Foods like yogurt, which contain healthy bacteria, can aid in better digestion. Vegetables can also be used in a similar way to accelerate weight loss. You should also look to lean meats, fish, and whole grains if you're aiming for a healthy digestive system.

[You may be able to better tolerate healthy foods by taking natural digestive enzymes with your meal.]

Ultimately, diet affects different people in different ways, so if you're having trouble, it's a good idea to keep a food diary to help you understand what's causing it.

Exercises to Aid Digestion - Food Diary
Start making changes for a healthier you
Taking care of your digestive system is very important to your overall health; feeling bloated, in pain, or generally feeling uncomfortable doesn't make for an enjoyable day.

It can be hard to resist temptation in the modern world, with the abundance of food and treats available and everything at your fingertips. However, it is essential that we make simple lifestyle changes that can benefit your body and your future.

Introduce a balanced diet, with light exercise, to keep your digestive system as fit and healthy as your body; Taking care of yourself for 15-30 minutes every day will give you a lifetime of pleasure, without having to worry about your digestive system screwing up.
