                   <h6>Exercises for good memory</h6>
The old adage "use it or lose it" applies not only to our physical health, but also to our cognitive health. We know that regular exercise is important, especially as we age and want to reduce our risk of developing diseases and other health problems associated with aging. For example, strength exercises can help build muscle and increase bone density, according to the Mayo Clinic; balance exercises can help prevent falls, according to MedlinePlus; and regular moderate to vigorous exercise can help maintain your range of motion to keep you limber, according to the National Institute on Aging (NIA).

Likewise, your brain's cognitive reserve -- its ability to withstand neurological damage from aging and other factors without showing signs of slowing down or memory loss -- can also benefit from exercise, both physical and cognitive. Just as weight training adds lean muscle to your body and helps you maintain muscle in your later years, the NIA notes that following a brain-healthy lifestyle and performing regular, targeted brain exercises can help boost your brain's cognitive reserve, although more research is needed. to confirm the effects.

5 Surprising Causes Of Memory Loss
Being forgetful can have underlying causes that you may not have known existed.
A whole-body approach for a healthy brain
So what types of exercise can benefit your brain? Research suggests that when it comes to keeping your mind sharp, exercising both your body and mind and sticking to healthy habits is the ideal formula.

Authors of a study published in July 2019 in The Journal of the American Medical Association followed approximately 196,400 participants aged 60 and older who had no cognitive impairment or dementia when they participated in the study for eight years. They collected data on the participants' lifestyle habits, such as current smoking status, regular exercise, healthy diet and alcohol consumption. Ultimately, researchers found that a healthy lifestyle was associated with a lower risk of dementia in participants, regardless of genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

Another study, published in Neurology in July 2020, found that people who participate in multiple healthy behaviors significantly reduce their risk of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. Over about six years, the study tracked five healthy lifestyle behaviors -- no smoking, regular exercise, low-to-moderate alcohol consumption, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, and engagement in activities that boost cognitive skills -- in nearly 2,800 adults and found that those who had at least four of those who followed the behaviors were about 60 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.

“Approaches to brain health include a balanced diet low in fat, low in cholesterol, and high in antioxidants,” says Robert Bender, MD, section chief of the Geriatric and Memory Center at Broadlawns Medical Center in Des Moines, Iowa. Foods high in antioxidants include nuts, fruits (especially berries), vegetables, chocolate and herbs and spices, previous research notes.

In addition to good nutrition, regular exercise can promote vascular health to help protect brain tissue. Avoiding drudgery and boredom is also critical. "The brain wants to learn new things," says Dr. Bender, adding that some researchers believe people are more vulnerable to dementia if they pay less attention to things around them. "When the brain is passive, it tends to atrophy," he adds. Therefore, sedentary and relatively passive activities, such as sitting in front of a TV for hours a day, can be detrimental to brain health over time.

Exercise can also be particularly beneficial for the brain. In a small study published in September 2018 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that a single 10-minute bout of low-intensity pedaling on a stationary bike was associated with increased activity in the brain's hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for creating new memories and remembering facts and events.

And a small study published in July 2019 in the Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society found that a single moderate-intensity exercise session right before a cognitive task resulted in greater brain activation. The researchers measured the brain activity of 26 healthy adults aged 55 to 85 on two different days. One day, they let participants rest for 30 minutes before identifying famous and non-famous names; on another day, they had participants pedal a stationary bike for 30 minutes before doing the same activity. The result: there was significantly more brain activation after exercise. This finding led researchers to conclude that exercise can instantly change the way our brains function, adding to the existing scientific evidence that physical activity helps boost brain function and memory.

10 brain exercises to boost memory and cognitive function
In addition to following the healthy lifestyle habits mentioned above, you can also keep your mind and memory sharp with exercises to train your brain — and you don't have to break the bank to do so. While there are plenty of computer games and apps that promise to improve cognitive function, there is no definitive research to show that these products have significant neurological benefits for older adults. A meta-analysis of eight clinical trials published in February 2020 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews found that while computer cognition training was associated with small short-term cognitive benefits, there is not enough high-quality research to support the use of brain games for preventing dementia or improving long-term cognitive function.

Health experts recommend sticking to brain training that involves activities in the real world instead. Exercises to boost brain function should provide novelty and challenge. "Almost any silly suggestion can work," says David Eagleman, PhD, a neuroscientist and adj
